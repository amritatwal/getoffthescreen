### Description
 
gots! is a Google Chrome extension that helps to avoid mindless internet browsing. By acting as a reminder upon each new tab opening, users are encouraged to think about their intention when browsing and given a helpful suggestion as to how they can get away from their screen.  

#### Purpose

The project's aim was to give me a taste of development outside of what I have been exposed to so far - I wanted to venture out from building web applications. I myself am trying to be more mindful of my screen time and internet habits, so thus gots! was born. 

#### Tech stack
JavaScript

#### Key features
- Helpful suggestions provided on-screen to avoid mindless internet consumption.
- Clean, minimalist design.
- Colours are dynamic and change upon each new tab or refresh.

#### What you could improve on
- The extension is rather simple at the moment so further functionality is needed (perhaps a timer that records how much time a user has spent using their         browser that day).
- More suggestions are needed.
    
#### Approach

- As the primary release remained to be quite simple, only JavaScript was needed to program and execute the logic. 
- Suggestions would be randomised in order to keep it engaging and fresh.
- Colours, too, I decided to have update and change in order to make up for the simplicity of the user interface.
- The user interface in general is intentionally clean and minimial that reflects my design aesthetics and do not create overwhelm for users. Browser extensions should enhance the user experience, not to distract them.
