### Description
 
gots! is a Google Chrome extension that helps to avoid mindless internet browsing. By acting as a reminder upon each new tab opening, users are encouraged to think about their intention when browsing and given a helpful suggestion as to how they can get away from their screen.  

#### Purpose

The project's aim was to give me a taste of development outside of what I have been exposed to so far - I wanted to venture out from building web applications. I myself am trying to be more mindful of my screen time and internet habits, so thus gots! was born.
